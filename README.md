## Game Description

The main action of the game is to use the A (left) and D (right) keys to maneuver a spaceship through a never ending cavern of boulders, craters and mysterious alien materials. The further you make it through the cavern the faster the ships speed and more obstacles are spawned.

The hardest part of the game to get working in Unreal was probably the level generation, I went through lots of different methods of trying to get a good distribution in the difficulty level vs speed vs obstacle spawning. Some of the ways I tried would be too steep a climb in difficulty or some would be too unbalanced when it came to speed vs obstacle spawning ratios.

The most interesting part of the game would definitely be the level generation again. The fact that the game is never ending, you'll never play the same run twice and that you can never predict the next obstacles to come before you makes the game exciting.
